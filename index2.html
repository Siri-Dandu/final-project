                <ol>
                  <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Before you get the kids cooking, put the noodles, vegetables, prawns and chicken in individual bowls for everyone to help themselves. Wash hands, put aprons on, sit the kids down and give them their own mixing bowl and spoon. Let them choose which ingredients they want (noodles are essential) in their rolls and if they want to graze as they choose, thatâs fine â all the ingredients are cooked or can be eaten raw. Add a bit of garlic and ginger, a tiny dash of soy and sprinkling of five-spice to each bowl and let them mix everything together.</li>
                  <li>Push the bowl aside and lay a sheet of pastry in front of each child. Ask them to spoon the filling down one side of each sheet then give them the beaten egg and a brush so they can brush around the edges. Then help them to roll them up neatly by folding both sides over the filling, then rolling them up.</li>
                  <li>Lift the spring rolls onto a baking tray, seam side down, brush with a little more egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if you want. Try to remember which child made which roll to save any arguments at the end! Bake the rolls for 20-25 mins or until golden.</li>
                  <li>While the rolls are in the oven, make the dipping sauce. Get the kids to mix all the ingredients together until the sugar has dissolved. When the spring rolls are golden and crisp, remove from the oven. Leave until cool enough to handle, cut into pieces for smaller kids, then let them eat, dipping the rolls into the sauce.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li> 1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
                  <li> 1 Onion (chopped)</li>
                  <li> 17 oz of passata</li>
                  <li> 29 oz vegetable stock</li>
                  <li> 1 garlic clove (crushed)</li>
                  <li>10 oz of arborio rice</li>
                  <li> Small glass of wine</li>
                  <li>1 oz of parmesan (or vegetarian alternative, grated knob of butter)</li>
                  <li> 3 tbsp of roughly chopped basil</li>
                  <li> 4 oz of mozzerella ball, cut into 12 pieces</li>
                  <li>3 oz seasoned flour</li>
                  <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                  <li>4 oz pack dried breadcrumbs </li>
                  <li>51oz oil for deep-frying</li>
                  <li>rocket greens, to serve</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="rec-head">Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based saucepan. Add the onion, cover and sweat until soft. In another pan, mix the passata and stock, and warm over a low heat.</li>
                  <li>Add the garlic to the onion, cook for 30 secs, then tip in the rice and stir to coat in the oil. Increase the heat, pour in the wine and let it simmer until absorbed. Keeping the pan over a medium heat, start adding the tomato stock mixture to the rice a ladleful at a time, letting the rice absorb most of the liquid after each addition. Keep stirring as you go, adding liquid until the rice is al dente â you may not need all the liquid. You donât want this to be as wet as a normal risotto, so keep cooking until your wooden spoon can stand up in it. Turn off the heat, stir through the Parmesan, butter and basil, then cover for 5 mins. Season and tip onto a tray to cool completely, then chill until firm.</li>
                  <li>Shape the risotto into 12 large balls. Make a hole in the centre with your finger and stuff in a piece of mozzarella, then reshape into a ball. Now start a little production line, dipping the balls in the flour, then the egg and coating with the breadcrumbs â then chill for 30 mins.</li>
                  <li>Heat the oil to 160C in a large deep saucepan and heat the oven to 180C/160 fan/gas 4. Deep-fry the risotto balls for 8-10 mins â youâll need to do this in batches. Drain on kitchen paper, then transfer to a tray and pop in the oven for 6-8 mins to make sure the mozzarella is completely melted. Sprinkle with salt, then leave to cool for a few moments before tucking in. Serve with some dressed rocket.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Put the tomatoes into a food processor in batches and whizz to a fine pulp. Sieve into a large pan, in batches again, pressing through as much tomato as you can with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 20-30 mins until the sauce has reduced by a third to about 700ml. This homemade passata can now be frozen.</li>
                  <li>Put the bacon or pancetta into a cold, large, heavy-based frying pan. Place over a medium heat â the fat will slowly melt and the bacon will cook. Add the whole chillies (donât worry, they come out at the end) and cook for 8-10 mins with the bacon until the bacon is sizzling and golden all over. Stir in the tomato sauce, bring to the boil and simmer for 4-5 mins.</li>
                  <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta, then drain well. While still hot, tip it into the sauce, sprinkle with most of the cheese and stir well. Remove the whole chillies, dish the pasta onto plates and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>Make hotteok dough:</li>
                  <li>Place 1 cup of lukewarm water into a mixing bowl.</li>
                  <li>Add 2 tbs white sugar, 2 ts yeast, Â½ ts salt, 1 tbs vegetable oil, and stir it well.</li>
                  <li>Add 2 cups of all purpose flour and mix it with a rice scoop, or by hand.</li>
                  <li>Let the dough rise. It should sit with the lid closed at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
                  <li>After an hour the dough will rise to double its size. Knead it to remove the gas bubbles in the dough.</li>
                  <li>Let it rise for another 10-20 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Make filling (for 8 hotteok):</li>
                  <li>Mix Â½ cup brown sugar, 1 ts cinnamon powder, and 2 tbs chopped walnuts in a bowl.</li>
                  <li>*tip: you could use mozzarella cheese for stuffing. Invent your own fillings with your favorite ingredients!</li>
                  <li>Letâs make hotteok!</li>
                  <li>Knead the dough again to remove the gas bubbles. Place and spread about Â½ cup flour on your cutting board.</li>
                  <li>Put the dough on your cutting board and knead it. Make it into a lump, and cut it into 8 equal-sized balls.</li>
                  <li>Take 1 dough ball, flatten it, put some filling in the center of the dough, and then seal it to make a ball. Repeat this 8 times to make 8 stuffed balls.</li>
                  <li>*tip: Use some flour from the cutting board to prevent your fingers from sticking to the dough</li>
                  <li>Heat up your non-stick pan over medium heat and add some vegetable oil.</li>
                  <li>Place 1 ball on the pan and let it cook for 30 seconds. When the bottom of the dough ball is light golden brown, turn it over and press the dough with a spatula to make a thin and wide circle (about the size of a CD).</li>
                  <li>Let it cook about 1 minute until the bottom is golden brown.</li>
                  <li>Turn it over again and turn down the heat very low. Place the lid on the pan and cook 1 more minute. The brown sugar filling mixture will be melted to syrup!hotteok (í¸ë¡)</li>
                  <li>Serve hot!</li>
